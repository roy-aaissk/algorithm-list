Algorithm List

Purpose

- Collection of representative algorithms implemented in Python 3.11
- Each algorithm file reads input from stdin and writes results to stdout (competition-style)

Structure

- `search/`, `sort/`, `graph/`, `dp/`, `strings/`, `examples/`, `tests/`

Usage example

- python3 search/linear.py < examples/linear.txt

Contributing

- Implementations prioritise readability for learning. Keep core algorithm functions single-responsibility (parse / algorithm / runner).
